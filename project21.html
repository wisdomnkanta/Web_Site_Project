    <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
    <p>
        Janice Malcomb started grooming her own pets in the early 1960s when she was given two poodle pups as a gift. 
        Although there were pet grooming businesses in the area, Janice could not bring herself to leave her 
        "babies" in the hands of others. She quickly became the groomer of choice for family and friends, 
        and after much encouragement opened up her own business in 1971. Janice takes pride in providing a motherly 
        care and a homey environment for pets during their time at Friendly Paws. With her partner and daughter, Amy, 
        she offers bathing, clipping, and overall grooming services for all types of dogs, cats, and even an occasional guinea pig.
